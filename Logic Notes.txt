general logic

create a deck of 52 cards
create card class with suit and rank
create deck class 

52 cards get added to the deck
A player has $500 to start with and makes a bet prior to the cards dealing out
This bet is added to the pot
A card gets removed from the deck array when its dealed out
Show dealers cards
show players cards
ask player if they want to hit or stand
if players hand is <21, ask if they like to hit again
if players hand == 21, blackjack
if player stands, the dealer plays their hand
dealer must always hit unless their hand is >= 17, in which case they can stand
determine winner based on win conditions

win conditions
blackjack = hand of 21
if no one has black jack winner = the player with the closest hand to 21
if winner, add winnings to PlayerBank.
if loser, subtract losses from PlayerBank
if PlayerBank = 0, time to go home!
